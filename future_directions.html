        <h1>CitePaL - Future Directions</h1>
        <h4>Based on the user study, future iterations of CitePaL should prioritize the following improvements:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Speed</li>
            <p>
              Currently, CitePaL is relatively slow. Both the hierarchy clustering 
              and populating the chart requires that the user wait for longer than 
              a person is used to waiting for a page to load. This delay caused one 
              user to think that the system wasn't working at all.
              The bottleneck is querying Semantic Scholar for hundreds of papers at 
              once. One way around this would be to store the Semantic Scholar data 
              on our own server, but this would need to be updated regularly and is 
              likely unsustainable.
              An intermediate fix would be to add an animated "loading" wheel, so the 
              user has more confidence that the site is still running.
            </p>
          <li>Intuitive-ness</li>
            <p>
              Some participants in the user study had questions about how to interpret
               the graph. For example, there were questions about what “shared” citations 
               really mean, whether the citation numbers were occurrences within a paper, 
               across the papers in the hierarchy, or across all papers. One solution for 
               this confusion could be tooltips with explanations that would show up when 
               a user hovers over a measure. 
            </p>
          <li>Categorization</li>
            <p>
              One user wanted clearer distinction between what papers were references and 
              what papers were contained in the selected hierarchies. In the next iteration,
               we would include this information as well as a way to differentiate reviews 
               from research papers, perhaps through keywords. Another category we thought 
               could be helpful is to highlight papers that share an author with the original 
               paper.
            </p>
        </ul>
