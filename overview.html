        <h1>CitePal - Overview</h1>
        <h4>Motivation</h4>
        <p>
            The idea behind the CitePaL is to provide build a tool that aids researchers 
            in quickly accessing relevant background and motivation for a given paper. 
            The main use case is a researcher who encounters a new paper in a line of 
            research that they are less familiar with. 
            
        </p>

        <h4>Current Methods</h4>

        <h5>Current methods in practice</h5>
        <p>
            Currently, researchers find foundational papers by word-of-mouth
            (talking to peers/mentors or hearing about papers during lectures),
            by combing through reference lists, or through keyword searches on
            paper aggregation sites. We hope CitePaL can be a tool to supplement
            or replace the last two strategies.
        </p>

        <h5>Related work</h5>

        Our approach (detailed below) relies on clustering the references and on surfacing most relevant papers for specific clusters.
        As far as we know, there is no current work which integrates both of these features into one system.
        However, we build on a large literature in citation clustering and paper recommendation systems.
        We note a few key papers below and how they differ from our approach.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Eigenfactor Recommends (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TBDATA.2016.2541167">
                West et al 2016</a>) analyzes a paper's citation graph to recommend similar
                "Expert" and "Classic" papers. This process is similar to our
                recommendation algorithm of surfacing papers using shared
                references. However, combining our algorithm with clustering
                allows for a more natural exploration of the different modes of
                a paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                SPECTER embeddings (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07180">Cohan et al 2020</a>)
                form the foundation of our clustering algorithm. However, they
                could be used directly for predicting similar papers, as
                proposed in the original paper. This covers a different use case
                than ours, as we focus on analyzing a paper's references, which
                may be in a different topic than the paper itself. Our tool
                would highlight more classic papers, whereas SPECTER embeddings
                would uncover similar contemporary papers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Threddy (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3526113.3545660">Kang et al 2022</a>) allows
                exploration of related papers based on specific concepts identified in a paper. This
                is a powerful system for finding references but requires more interaction from the user on a paper than our demo.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Approach</h4>
        <p>
            
            We built a tool that aids researchers in finding background papers when reading
            unfamiliar content. Using our tool, a researcher inputs the url of a single 
            paper, and receives a list of three or four key papers that the given paper
            builds on, along with an interactive interface to explore 
            the corpus of reference papers. The interactive interface consists of two 
            components; a paper hierarcy and a scatter plot. Using this tool, users 
            can explore the corpus of reference papers, examine the main topics related to
            these references, and navigate to the recommended 'foundational' papers.
            
        </p>

        <h5>Reference Hierarchy</h5>
        <p> To group papers, we use hierachical clustering (using Ward method with euclidean distance)
            <a href="https://github.com/allenai/specter">SPECTER embeddings</a> provided by Semantic Scholar.
            We use GPT-3 (using the davinci-003 model) to generate a title for each group based on the titles of the groups or papers below it.
            We use the following prompt:
            <pre>I am writing a review paper including the following papers:
  [input list of paper references or group titles]
A review paper summarizing and synthesizing all of the above papers
would have the short but descriptive title of ...</pre>
        </p>


        <h5>Visual Exploration</h5>
        <p> To facilitate the visual exploration of referenced papers, we used Altair to
            createa an interactive scatter plot. Each point represents a single paper and 
            the corpus of papers is made of two levels of references; the  references
            of the selected paper, and the references of those papers. This allows users 
            to explore a wider range of papers that may be relevant. Relevance of any paper
            is represented by three metrics, the date it was published (x axis), the citation 
            count from Semantic Scholar (y axis), and the number of cross references 
            (color and size). Cross references refers to how many papers in the selected 
            corpus (all the paper shown in the plot), cite a given paper. So if the cross
            reference count for a given paper is five, that means that five papers within 
            the corpus cite that paper. 

            The selection of papers is set but the user based on the checked boxes in the 
            paper hierarchy above. Finally we've incorporated a tooltip so that users can 
            hover over any point to see the title, first author and year of publication.
        </p>


        <h5>Recommended Papers</h5>
        <p> The top ten recommended papers that appear as links after the user selects 
          “Show the graph!” or ordered first by number of “shared” citations, i.e. how 
          many of the papers in the selected hierarchies reference that paper and then 
          by total number of citations. Drawbacks of this method are that it preserves 
          any existing biases for which papers are cited more frequently. We hope that 
          by providing the entire chart in an eye-catching way it will encourage users 
          to explore the wider corpus of referenced papers more fully. 
        </p>


        <h5>Example Dataset</h5>
        <p> The example dataset is made up of assigned readings from CSE599D: The Future 
          of Scholarly Communication. Exploring the auto-generated hierarchies of these 
          papers allows a user to quickly see an overview of the range of topics covered
          in the course.
