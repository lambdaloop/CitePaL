        <h1>CitePal - Overview</h1>
        <h4>Motivation:</h4>
        <p>
            The idea behind the CitePaL is to provide build a tool that aids researchers 
            in quickly accessing relevant background and motivation for a given paper. 
            The main use case is a researcher who encounters a new paper in a line of 
            research that they are less familiar with. 
            
        </p>

        <h4>Current Methods:</h4>

        </p>

        <h4>Approach:</h4>
        <p>
            
            We built a tool that aids researchers in finding background papers when reading
            unfamiliar content. Using our tool, a researcher inputs the url of a single 
            paper, and receives a list of three or four key papers that the given paper
            builds on, along with an interactive interface to explore 
            the corpus of reference papers. The interactive interface consists of two 
            components; a paper hierarcy and a scatter plot. Using this tool, users 
            can explore the corpus of reference papers, examine the main topics related to
            these references, and navigate to the recommended 'foundational' papers.
            
        </p>

        <h5>Reference Hierarchy:</h5>
        <p> Information on the reference hierarchy. I group papers using hierachical clustering based on the
            <a href="https://github.com/allenai/specter">SPECTER embeddings</a> provided by Semantic Scholar.
            Then, to interpret the groups, I use GPT3 to generate a title for each group based on the titles of the groups below it.
            The group titles are the key aspect of the demo and allow the user to browse an <b>interpretable</b> hieararchy.

        </p>


        <h5>Visual Exploration:</h5>
        <p> To facilitate the visual exploration of referenced papers, we used Altair to
            createa an interactive scatter plot. Each point represents a single paper and 
            the corpus of papers is made of two levels of references; the  references
            of the selected paper, and the references of those papers. This allows users 
            to explore a wider range of papers that may be relevant. Relevance of any paper
            is represented by three metrics, the date it was published (x axis), the citation 
            count from Semantic Scholar (y axis), and the number of cross references 
            (color and size). Cross references refers to how many papers in the selected 
            corpus (all the paper shown in the plot), cite a given paper. So if the cross
            reference count for a given paper is five, that means that five papers within 
            the corpus cite that paper. 

            The selection of papers is set but the user based on the checked boxes in the 
            paper hierarchy above. Finally we've incorporated a tooltip so that users can 
            hover over any point to see the title, first author and year of publication.
        </p>


        <h5>Recommended Papers:</h5>
        <p> The top ten recommended papers that appear as links after the user selects 
          “Show the graph!” or ordered first by number of “shared” citations, i.e. how 
          many of the papers in the selected hierarchies reference that paper and then 
          by total number of citations. Drawbacks of this method are that it preserves 
          any existing biases for which papers are cited more frequently. We hope that 
          by providing the entire chart in an eye-catching way it will encourage users 
          to explore the wider corpus of referenced papers more fully. 
        </p>
