        <h1>CitePaL - User Study</h1>
        <p>
          To test the efficacy of our tool we conducted a brief user study.
          We sent out a survey to our academic friends and lab mates at different 
          career stages and received 5 responses (1 research tech, 1 postdoc, 
          3 grad students in different fields). For each we described the purpose 
          of the site and asked them to try it out and answer a few questions. The 
          results are shown below.

        </p>
        <h4>
          Would you use a web-based application/plug-in to visually search for 
          background papers when doing academic literature search?
        </h4>
        <img src = "./images/q1.png" alt = "Responses to Q1" />

        <h4>
          When using this tool, did the suggested papers seem relevant to you?
        </h4>
        <img src = "./images/q2.png" alt = "Responses to Q2" />

        <h4>
          What information did you find useful in this application?
        </h4>
        <p>In general, people liked the topic categorization of reference papers
          and the recommendations that followed.
        </p>

        <h4>
          What information did you wish you could see when using this application?
        </h4>
        <p>People wished that the different aspects of the tool were a little clearer
          or easier to understand at a glance. One aspect that we are very aware of 
          is it is pretty slow to create the hierarchy and the interactive graph.
          The main bottleneck here is querying Semantic Scholar for hundreds of papers 
          at once, so optimizing for speed would be our next priority.
        </p>
